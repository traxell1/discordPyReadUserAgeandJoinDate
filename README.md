# discordPyReadUserAgeandJoinDate
A very simple discordpy script for display the dates at which users joined a particular server, and how old their account is.

1. Requires the creation of an application to be used as the bot that will join the server via https://discord.com/developers/applications
  Note: Server Members Intent must be enabled (under application tab "Bot" on the developers page).
2. Requires the server ID of the server (guild) that will need to be read. https://poshbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/backends/setup-discord-backend/#find-your-guild-id-server-id
